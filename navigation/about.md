Hi, my name is Trevor and I'm a junior at Del Norte High School who aspires to be a computer scientist. 

I've been programming for on and off since 5th grade, but it wasn't until last year before I started seeing it as a career path. As of now, I'm fluent in python, javascript, html/css, and I'm currently learning Java. 

In the past year, I've worked in groups using agile methodologies extensively and I've produced many projects that I'm proud of. Check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trevor-huang-003391304/) for projects that I'm especially proud of.

My dream is to contribute to technologies that will end up changing people's lives for the better. I'm interested in cutting edge technology such as **artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics, and more!** When I'm not coding or doing robotics, you might catch me running cross country/track, playing chess, or learning something new! Feel free to contact me by sending me a message on LinkedIn or shooting me an email at trevorhuangsd@gmail.com.
