    "1. **Input Validation:**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Conditions to Consider:**\n",
    "   - Use `if-else` statements to check for membership qualifications.\n",
    "   - Remember to handle multiple conditions where a user qualifies for more than one membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recommendation Logic:**\n",
