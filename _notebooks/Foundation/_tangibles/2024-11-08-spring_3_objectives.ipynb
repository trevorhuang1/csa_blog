Rachit also verbally mentioned how he wanted to see an easier, more intuitive way to manage students, since the admin panel was pretty rough at the time of our showcase.\n",

    "- Having a map or an visual way to see the bathrooms beforehand was something that our group had discussed prior to N@TM, but never had the time to finish. This idea will definitely be worked on in the future, since it would be nice to have a visual element to discern between bathrooms, especially if certain ones have much more issues than others."
