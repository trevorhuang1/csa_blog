    "- Bathroom pass: created bathroom logging ([tinkle](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_2025/commit/e2f4e06fc5db15d3148f6ab54d4afd1923db16ce)) with a OneToOne relationship\n",
    "- Bathroom pass: This was scrapped, but I learned how to set up an [automated emailing system](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_2025/commit/da18e58be83efffe2e5f3c5abb0489b5c146671c) to bathroom approvalLinks with SpringBoot\n",
    "- Analytics: Side quest assigned by Aadit. I made analytics for individual bathroom usage data on the frontend paired with Eric's grading data. Unfortunately, I changed the formatting for the times a while ago and forgot to change the analytics page, so some of this is broken (**5 minute fix**)\n",
