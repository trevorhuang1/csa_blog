    "- Bathroom pass: created bathroom logging ([tinkle](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_2025/commit/e2f4e06fc5db15d3148f6ab54d4afd1923db16ce)) with a OneToOne relationship\n",

    "- Bathroom pass: This was scrapped, but I learned how to set up an [automated emailing system](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_2025/commit/da18e58be83efffe2e5f3c5abb0489b5c146671c) to bathroom approvalLinks with SpringBoot\n",

    "- Analytics: Side quest assigned by Aadit. I made [analytics](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/portfolio_2025/commit/205a8873176313a419ded82ec8d8bc50490dc4d0) for individual bathroom usage data on the frontend paired with Eric's grading data. Unfortunately, I changed the formatting for the times a while ago and forgot to change the analytics page, so some of this is broken (**5 minute fix**)\n",

It is functional and works well with scanner and digital bathroom pass, but as discussed with Mr. Mortensen, it still needs work. There are many parts that still need fine tuning to be actually useable for an administrator.\n",
